<h2>Flashcommander Library 1.0</h2>

<h3>RemoteFileList components</h3>

<p>
The RemoteFileList components can be used to browse a remote file system.
<br/><br/>
The four components - <b>RemoteFileGrid, RemoteFileTile, RemoteFileList, RemoteFileHList</b> - extend list based components 
with properties and methods that allow navigation and file operations.
<br/><br/>
The server side code is an <b>amfphp</b> class placed in <b>amfphp/services/flashcommander_lib_1_0/FileList</b>.
</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>
You can simply import the downloaded files as a Flex project.<br/>
If you create a new Flex project you have to add <b>libs/remotefilelist.swc</b> to the build path.
<br/> 
To do this open "Project properties/Flex Build path" and on the "Library path" tab add remotefilelist.swc to the project.
<br/><br/> 

The php code is in the amfphp folder - copy this folder to your webserver.<br/>
The <b>endpoint</b> of a RemoteFileList should point to amfphp/gateway.php.<br/>
You also have to specify a <b>directory</b> to display - this is a relative path from amfphp/services/flashcommander_lib folder.
<br/><br/>

For more info check the <b>sample applications</b> (bin folder) and the <b>asdoc</b> (doc folder).<br/>

</p>

<h4>License</h4>
<p>
You can use the components for free.<br/>
However if you want to remove branding you need to pay a license fee.<br/><br/>
